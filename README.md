This repository is a hands-on exercise using a mixed-effects model to analyze the sleepstudy dataset from the lme4 library. The impact of sleep deprivation on psychomotor vigilance was examined as the main research question from the Belenky et al. 2003 study. The data from the study is the main content of the sleepstudy dataset, especially focusing on the 18 subjects from the 3-hour sleep deprivation group. The mixed effect model is suitable to analyze the sleepstudy dataset because the independence of observation assumption for standard linear regression has been violated. Multiple observations were recorded from the 18 participants over a period of ten days, which aggregate to 180 observations. Hence, the need to use mixed effect models because it considers the fixed and random effects that occur from multiple observations from participants. The results of the analysis provide insights into the effect of sleep deprivation on psychomotor performance based on reaction time over ten days. The data exploration and descriptive analysis of the dataset were also examined to get the key detailed information of the study.
